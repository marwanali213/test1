                        <b>Find your projector.</b>Projectors are useful for identifying robots, inspect their components and monitor their patrol paths, but beware of flaws. "Because Aloy's movements and actions are limited when using a projector, tall grass is good for hiding," says director Mathijs de Jonge. “Then I pour certain components that I have identified onto the target bots to inflict significant damage, especially when confronted with dangerous bots.”</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Creative in the use of traps.</b>It's rare for you to survive a full-fledged battle during the initial game stages, as even a couple of Watchers can easily defeat you. That's why it's important to exploit traps to impede enemy movements or lower their health, especially when following a robot's path. “Tackling a large enemy for a long time using something like a rope thrower is really helpful,” explains combat designer Troy Mashburn. "You can come back to it after taking over other enemies - or even have the robot tear itself apart trying to get away."</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Use the items.</b>Exploiting a racist bot's weaknesses can be the difference between life and death, so use the projector to see what works and prepare yourself accordingly to inflict maximum damage. It's also useful to check that you know what items these particular bots can unleash in their attacks - this might make a tough fight easier. “Preparing potions, especially those that can give you elemental immunity, is a huge help, as it reduces the amount of damage you take in these struggles,” says lead novelist John Gonzales.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="info-hent">
                <ol start="4">
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Expand your weapons range.</b> Most robots come equipped with special weapon components that can be shredded with a few precision-aimed rubber darts – meaning you can turn the tide of battle. "You'll never get Thundergo in one fell swoop," a warning from lead novelist John Gonzales. “But if you detonate his disc ejector, use stealth to evade his attacks and turn his weapon against him, then that can be a huge help.”</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Balance both shoulders by overtaking.</b> If you struggle to fight multiple robots, getting past some of them to fight for you may increase your chances of survival. Just in case you don't want to get too close, shooting the Arrows of Corruption can wreak enough chaos for you to rest and watch the battle go on, before you go back to get rid of the survivors.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Keep moving.</b> Agility and agility are the most important attributes of Aloy, and there is no load bar to limit your running or dodge. Her dribbling roll is very important to avoiding bot attacks, so always be prepared to use her, before launching a counterattack.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Let Aloy be your guide.</b> Focus heavily on Aloy's head movements and speech, as they will help you as you explore. Her head will usually move in the direction of something interesting (it's often a resource you can gather), while her words can sometimes let you know when an enemy catches you or stops the chase.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Don't be afraid to run away.</b> If your presence is caught by powerful bots by mistake or you feel like you've entered a fight where you can't win, run. "In Horizon, running away doesn't mean failure," says lead mission designer David Ford. "It's part of playing tactically, so it's okay to just hide and hide. Most enemies will continue to look for you in the last place you've been eliminated, so assess your situation and fight again when you find a way to take them out."</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Get out and explore.</b> "Get off the rugged road" encouragement from lead fiction designer John Gonzales. "There are many different details, such as the textual records from the ancient world, which are pieces of a puzzle that you solve to understand the larger story." "If you're really hard at exploring, you'll find a hidden outfit with hot traits early in the game," says Chief Mission Designer David Ford. "You won't get the items needed to unlock it until later, but if you explore and collect caffeine, you'll find the keys you need to unlock the door for that piece of clothing."</p>
